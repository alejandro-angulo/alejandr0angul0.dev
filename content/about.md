## The Site

This is a static site generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). There's a public repo for this site
[here](https://github.com/alejandro-angulo/alejandr0angul0.dev). Nothing fancy going on. I'm planning on using this site as a sort
of personal documentation. Hopefully what I write here will be useful to whoever stumbles upon it.

For you vim fans, this site supports scrolling vertically with vim bindings (as long as you allow this site to run javascript). As
of now the following are supported:

- `j` (scrolls down)
- `k` (scrolls up)
- `gg` (scrolls to top)
- `G` (scrolls to bottom)

## Me

I'm Alejandro Angulo, a code monkey living in the Los Angeles area. When I'm not ~~introducting bugs~~ writing beautiful,
performant code I like [working on random personal projects](https://github.com/alejandro-angulo/qmk_firmware/), going to the gym,
and hanging out with my girlfiend and my chihuahua.

## Contact

I can be reached at `iam@<the domain of this site>`.

## The Site

This is a static site generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). There's a public repo for this site
[here](https://github.com/alejandro-angulo/alejandr0angul0.dev). Nothing fancy going on. I'm planning on using this site as a sort
of personal documentation. Hopefully what I write here will be useful to whoever stumbles upon it.

## Me

I'm Alejandro Angulo, a code monkey living in the Los Angeles area. When I'm not ~~introducting bugs~~ writing beautiful,
performant code, I like to reminisce about the before-times when masks weren't in style and sit-down dining was a thing. Nowadays,
I like to pass the time binge watching TV shows on Hulu/Netflix and starting (but not finishing) personal projects.

### Contact

I can be reached at `iam@<the domain of this site>`.
